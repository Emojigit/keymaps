# keymaps
A collection of community made keymaps for PlayCover.

If you want to contribute by adding keymaps, export your keymapping and add a folder with the the bundle identifier of your app. Adding information about your keymap in the README is entirely optional. You can also just post your keymapping in our discord server in the keymapping channel.

**The aspect ratio of your keymap must be stated (16:10, 16:9, etc).**
