RL Sideswipe runs well with Playcover. 
However some part of the UI menu are unusable with the mouse. 

I recommand to play it with a controller. 
This Keymap is there to allow you to navigate through the Menu / Login / Settings with the keyboard. In game you should use your controller or add some other keys if you want to use your keyboard.

I made sure that all the main actions like Search for a new match with mode selection / go To settings / Launch a training etc are doable entirely via the keyboard. 

Press Cmd-K to see the keys you need to use.
