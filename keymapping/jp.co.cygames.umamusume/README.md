## Umamusume: Pretty Derby keymapping
A keymap made by zvuc#7777

To whom this may interest...

I made a keymap for Uma Musume Pretty Derby (ウマ娘プリティーダービー). Since PlayCover doesn't officially support GUI based keymapping in vertical games (the option is greyed out), I manually measured relative on-screen XY coordinates (percentage) then laid out buttons for most used actions during training session. In actual usage, I've found the X/C buttons most useful to quickly press Cancel/OK on modals, and Esc=Right Mouse Click to go back a step anytime.

The keymap positions are based on the iPad size app. 

ウマ娘のキーマップ作りました。ガイドの画像を参考にしてください。X「キャンセル」C「確認」Esc＝右マウスボタン「戻る」この３つだけ覚えといて使うとかなり便利です。
